What css rule did you use?
    The background-color rule. 
How would you write it in a css file so that only this div gets the new background color?
    You could write it inline as <div id="div1" style="background-color:yellowgreen;">
What does changing the margin do? What does changing the padding do?
    Changing the margin changed the space around the boxes. Changing the padding impacted the area of each box. 

3.
What happens if the margin is greater than 100px?
    When the margin is greater than 100px, it is pushed entirely outside of the box it was in as the margin pushes it away from the edge of the page.
What happens if the padding is greater than 100px?
    When the padding is greater than 100px it makes the yellow area around the text much larger. 
What is the difference between scroll and hidden?
    Hidden cuts off the overflow and just hides it. Scroll cuts off the overflow but lets you scroll to see it all.

4.
What order are they in?
    They are still ordinal and from left to right are div 1, div 2, and then div 3.
What if they all have the float: right attribute instead?
    Their order is reversed: 3,2,1.
Keeping all divs with the float: right attribute, give each one in turn the two attributes float: left and clear: right.
Describe the relative positions of the boxes with each combination.
    With box 1 having the attributes, it is seperated further from the other two and the order is 1,3,2.
    With box 2 having the attributes, it is a line below box 1 and it is left aligned while 1 and 3 are along the right side of the page. 
    With box 3 having the attributes, box 1 and 2 are in reverse order on the first line on the right of the page, and below them is box three along the left of the page. 

5.
What changes?
    The boxes shifted as far left as they could. 
What does this tell you about the default margin value?
    This shows that the default margin value is not 0.
